  <h1>[DRAFT] Idea: Robot Operating Certificate</h1>
  <p><i>September 24, 2025</i></p>
  <p>A thought experiment: <br/>It takes 7 years of supervised experience to become licensed as a master plumber.  (Yes, I know this varies some state-by-state and whether or not the plumber got a journeyman's license first, but stick with me.)  
  If the plumber does 4 jobs a day (which may be generous, but I want to use conservative estimates), works 5 days a week, for 50 weeks per year, then during those 7 years of supervision the plumber with have 7000 uniques work experiences (4 x 5 x 50 x 7 = 7000).
  Now, suppose you had a fleet of 10000 humanoid robots dedicated to plumbing.  Before going out to the field, their AIs can be trained on 100000 or 1000000 simulated plumbing experiences.  But, simulations aren't exactly the same as the real world; so, the real world 
  probably still matters.  Suppose the robots work at the same speed as human plumbers (it might take time to walk back to the truck to get parts and tools).  After 2 hours into their first shift, the fleet of robot plumbers have as much real-workd experience as a
  new human master plumber because robots should be able to share their real world experiences by recording it as digital data.  It seems certain that robots are coming for even the hardest of the trade jobs, and will thus be used inplace of humans.</p>
  
  <p>Now, continuing the thought experiment, suppose that you have a plumbing problem at your house.  You call a plumbing service and they send a robot plumber to fix the problem.  Nothing weird about that in our soon-to-arrive techno-future.  The robot takes care of
  the problem, and as it nears the end of the job, it is soldering a new pipe piece in place.  Your purring cat comes over to the robot.  It arches its back and does a little hop to rub against the robot's arm, bumping the robot.  The robot's bumped arm is holding 
  the soldering torch, which now catches the cabinetry on fire.  The robot springs into immediate action and gets you and the cat to safety, but your house is in ruins!</p>
  
  <p>This thought experiment may be a little forced, but its point is that despite huge amounts of training, the real world still contains unknowns and suprises.  This means that the fleets of humanoid robots and their operators will need to use and adopt organizational
  and governance solutions that have already been pioneered in other industries for other problems.</p>

  <h2>Robot Operating Certificate</h2>

  <p>It's obvious from the thought experiment that humanoid robots will need liability insurance.  Online marketplaces for ordering robotic work will demand it.  But, that is only one of the problems that the forthcoming humanoid robot industry will face.</p>

  <p>Another is that humanoid robot manufacturers and robot fleet managers will face a public stigma, or worse, from people feeling that the robots are stealing people's jobs.  Humans have a strong survival instinct and a job is most humans' lifeline for food, shelter, 
  clothing, and every other necessity.</p>

  <p>A third issue is that the Insurers will demand the robots to have certain high-quality aspects in order to make the insurance products profitable enough to be worthwhile for their business.  The robots will need to be up-to-date on the cybersecurity and software patching.
  They need to receive regular maintenance.  They need safety telemetry to reduce OSHA headaches.  They need to be bonded and have audit logs for instantaneous arbitration.  There are probably many other requirements because I am not an insurance expert.</p>

  <p>A Robot Operating Certificate scheme can be a market-driven solution to all of these problems.  The certification program would be operated by an independant, non-profit association whose goal is high-quality humanoid robotics that benefit everyone.  The program 
  would measure the quality and performance metrics that the insurance companies demand.  The manufacturers or fleet operators can pay a fee to the association to have the robot measured and inspected.  Once the insurance is issued, the work marketplaces will be satisfied.  
  The marketplaces that use only certified robots should have a marketing edge over the marketplaces that use uncertified robots because the certified robots will be perceived as safer.  The non-profit association can require regular re-certification, and will thus have a 
  stream of income from the certification fees.  Since the association is a non-profit, they could distribute the fees to every verified human in their territory/nation at a flat rate.  Effectively a source of a Universal Basic Income, the certification program would be 
  perceived very positively by the general public.  Not only would it be improving the quality of the robots working out in society, but they would be sharing some of the profits of the robots back with the public whose jobs had been taken over by the robots. This is a
  win-win.</p>
