    <p>Spooky Edition!
  <ul>
    <li>GitHub posted a blog article with more details about their "Agent HQ" plan for AI agents, but I don't see any new details about how to programmatically initiate an AI agent workflow in it: <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/welcome-home-agents/" target="_blank">Introducing Agent HQ: Any agent, any way you work</a></li>
    <li>In a weird one, researchers at Anthropic experimented on Claude to see if it could recognize when they gave it "intrusive thoughts", and sometimes it did: <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-scientists-hacked-claudes-brain-and-it-noticed-heres-why-thats" target="_blank">Anthropic scientists hacked Claude’s brain — and it noticed. Here’s why that’s huge</a></li>
    <li>I listened to this review of the new book warning against AI superintelligence, <em>If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies</em>. On YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8RtMHuFsUw" target="_blank">POV: What You Would See During an AI Takeover</a>.  It features an AI that gains superintelligence on accident and then does a bunch of dastardly deeds to survive and then eventually it kills everyone.  The common denominator in these stories that I don't quite understand yet is why does the superintelligent AI become a boogeyman instead of a buddha?</li>
